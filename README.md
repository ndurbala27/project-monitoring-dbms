# project-monitoring-dbms

1. a very simple relational database called 'projmon' - short for project monitoring system.
   
2. development environment used:

on my Windows 10 desktop
1. WAMP -->  https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/
2.  MySql workbench  -->  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

on my HP laptop running Distro: LMDE 6 Faye base: Debian 12.1 bookworm
1. I already had MySql workbench installed on this machine.
2. I followed these steps to install Apache -->  https://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/486
3. I followed these steps to install PHP -->  https://www.linuxbuzz.com/how-to-install-php-on-debian/#google_vignette
4. I followed these stops to insall phpMyadmin -->  https://kifarunix.com/install-phpmyadmin-on-debian-12/#installing-php-my-admin-on-debian-12-1
5. I wanted to revisit the phpmyadmin UI, and see real-time changes I made between MySql Workbench and phpmyadmin. Results: successfull changes to schemas reflect in both intefaces.
