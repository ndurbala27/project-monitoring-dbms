# project-monitoring-dbms

Task:  develop and query a very simple relational database called 'projmon' - short for project monitoring system.

Purpose:
1. to revisit concepts and refresh my knowledge on 
-  how to correctly structure databases
-  how to author efficient SQL statements and clauses
-  how to manage SQL databases for scalable growth

   
Development environment used:

1. on my Windows 10 desktop
- WAMP -->  https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/
- MySql workbench  -->  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

2. on my HP laptop running Distro: LMDE 6 Faye base: Debian 12.1 bookworm
- I already had MySql workbench installed on this machine.
- I followed these steps to install Apache -->  https://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/486
- I followed these steps to install PHP -->  https://www.linuxbuzz.com/how-to-install-php-on-debian/#google_vignette
- I followed these steps to insall phpMyadmin -->  https://kifarunix.com/install-phpmyadmin-on-debian-12/#installing-php-my-admin-on-debian-12-1
- I wanted to revisit the phpmyadmin UI, and see real-time changes I made between MySql Workbench and phpmyadmin. Results: successfull changes to schemas reflect in both intefaces.
